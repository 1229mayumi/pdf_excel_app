How Japan's electronics dominance shifted to niche B2B fields

While Japan has been surpassed by regional
competitors in recent decades when it comes to
mass-produced, end-consumer (B2C) electron-
ics, Nippon manufacturers today lead the way
in the B2B sphere, producing parts, materials
and equipment essential to the manufacture of
semiconductors and other electronic components.
Often working in high-tech, niche areas, these
companies are harnessing Japan’s manufacturing,
engineering and innovative prowess to deliver
high-quality solutions for the latest technologies,
such as smart devices, Al, VR/AR, IoT, electric ve-
hicles (EVs) and high-speed telecommunications.

“While Japan continues to be extraordinarily
capable and dominates a broad set of materi-
als, equipment, and components that allow the
global technology industry to run, its participa-
tion in the industry has migrated from a B2C
model to a B2B model,” explains Scott Callon,
Chairman and CEO of Japan Display Inc. (JDI),a
company that is developing groundbreaking and
unique display technologies such as eLEAP, the
next generation of OLED screens. "We've chosen
to do things that are hard rather than easy,”
adds the JDI CEO. “Our engineers are generating
first-in-the-world, first-in-history breakthroughs.
This is excruciatingly hard. But that is part of
our strategy, to do things that are really hard,
because then you leave your competitors behind
and create unique value for customers by build-
ing things that no one else can build.”

Creating unique and niche technologies is
also the competitive strength of Nissei Electric,
a manufacturer of insulation, transmission,
and wave motion technology. "We develop,
manufacture and sell wires, cables and tubes
made mainly from fluoroplastics and silicone
rubber, as well as optical components, mainly
fiber optics. In addition to the characteristics of
our materials, our unique processing methods
enable us to meet the demands of a wide range
of industries,” says Nissei’s president Hidehiko
Kirino. "Over time, we have expanded into di-
verse industries such as OA (office automation),
telecommunications and factory automation, -
making full use of the various properties of our
materials and our unique processing technology
- and are aiming to further expand into robotics,
medical equipment, semiconductor manufactur-
ing equipment, mobility and other fields."

japan once held the top position in the manu
facture of finished semiconductors, but now
its competitive edge can be found in the field
of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
including equipment used in essential cleaning
processes. “Japanese companies have large
shares, globally, in terms of semiconductor
cleaning equipment,” stresses Masayuki Bouno,
President of J.ET,, which aims to expand its op-
erations in the fast-growing US. semiconductor
market. "We have signed an agreement with
Samsung Electronics to deliver our cleaning

equipment to their new plant in Taylor, Texas.
With that as the starting point, we would like
to start expanding into North America so that
we can find new customers there.”

Meanwhile, Shibuya Corporation - a manu-
facturer of bottling and packaging systems for
a range of industries - supplies products used
in the backend of semiconductor manufactur-
ing. “The industry is dramatically changing
right now,” states company president Hidetoshi
Shibuya. "New needs are emerging, with the
prevalence of large-scale data centers, AI and
new mobility solutions including EVs. We are
developing nano-level mounting technologies
that are required especially for large-scale
chips used for AI and large-scale data centers.”

Japanese companies engaged in the manu-
facture of high-performance materials are
also playing their part in the development
of the latest electronics technologies, with
Toshiko Sakane, President and CEO of LST
Corporation, giving an example of what her
company is doing in this regard. "One of our
collaboration projects involves our low color
polyimide film, TORMED,” she reveals. "We've
been working with print circuit manufacturers
in Japan. Through this collaboration, we have
successfully created a clear flexible print cir-
cuit, which has been used in augmented reality
(AR) headsets widely used for virtual training,
including by the US. Army.”

Nissei Electric looking to be the number one
company in niche markets

As a comprehensive manufacturer engaged in insulation, transmission and wave motion, Nissei Electric aims to

address niche market requirements from clients operating in a wide range of industries.

“We want to be a

good partner for our
customers, working
together with them to
develop the requirements
they want to realize.”

The Hamamatsu region in which
Nissei Electric operates has a
mild climate where cotton cul-
tivation flourished in the past,
allowing many textile industries
‘to grow there. Nissei Electric's
roots can be traced back to the
manufacture of braided cotton
laces and this braiding technol-
ogy remains a fundamental tech-
nology still evolving today.

Car manufacturers Toyota and
Suzuki were the predecessors
of the loom manufacturers. And
manufacturers in the region have
since expanded into the fields
of ‘insulation’ using silicone rub-
ber for automobiles, industrial
machinery and household ap-
pliances, ‘transmission’ using

fluoropolymers for communi-
cations, mobile equipment and
medical applications, and ‘wave
motion’ using optical fibers for
semiconductor equipment and
sensing. Japanese manufactur-
ers have also been responsible
for the innovative development
of printers, MFPs and other of-
fice automation equipment, espe-
cially in roll products used in the
fusing process, offering uniquely
developed solutions.

For its part, Nissei Electric of-
fers unique products to a diverse
range of industries, combining
three high-performance materials

GigaEx is a generic term for
high-speed signal transmission
products, comprising conven-
tional metal cables, optical fibers
and antenna products for wire-
less communications. Another
strength of the Japanese firm
is its ability to handle hybrid
products combining metal and
optical transmission. Particularly
in the fields of FA, robotics and
semiconductors, Nissei Electric
focuses on the development of
next-generation high-speed in-
terface products with functions
such as bending, twisting, and
noise resistance, as well as flex-
ibility and thin diameter - with
solutions such as the AOC opti-
cal interface, which is optimized
for high-speed transmission at
speeds in excess of 10 Gbps.

and can also be made in a variety
of structures to suit different needs,
suchas tapered or flared tube ends,
multi-layered hybrid products and
stretched products. Using micro-
